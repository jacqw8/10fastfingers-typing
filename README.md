# 10fastfingers-typing
This is a bot that pulls up the 10fastfingers website and automatically types the words. The WPM is adjustable, going higher than 300 WPM. This is a great prank to pull on
your friends -- watch their surprise as you show them your world record breaking score! This code was written as a project to learn Selenium, only a few weeks after learning Python.
